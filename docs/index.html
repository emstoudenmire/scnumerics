<h1>SC Numerics</h1>
<p>In the spring of 2020, a few of us got together to assess the state-of-the-art in the field of numerical approaches
of strongly correlated systems. We quickly realized that even though there are many good texts out there,
they all speak different languages. This applied to our interactions as well, we as computational physicists
wanted to understand each other better but realized we were not aware of progresses in each other's respective fields.
In addition, we wanted our students to have a broader understanding of this area of physics.</p>
<p>This motivated us to put together a book about numerical methods for strongly correlated electron systems. It is targeted
at a young graduate student entering this field. It can not be emphasized enough, but we say very passionately from our experience:
Computational physics is not only about making code go faster - it really demands new physical insights that will help
solve computers solve some of the most outstanding set of problems of our generation involving strongly correlated systems.
These systems are at the heart of high Tc superconductivity, magnetism and quantum Hall physics. We wish to expose
the young student to what the frontiers of this field are, and where they can make an impact. We are hopeful that
our enthusiasm and passion for the subject will simulate breakthroughs in this field.</p>
<p>And finally, even if computational physics is not your primary area of interest, we hope you can still get the basic ideas
that are involved in each method. In short, we hope you can enjoy it as much as we did while putting it together.
Since this book remains very much under development, your feedback will be greatly valued.
